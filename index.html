        <p style="color: rgb(27, 154, 204); font-size: large;">Building your own computer may seem like a daunting project, especially for a first timer. You might be worried it's too complex, too expensive, or too time-consuming, but it doesn't have to be!<br>

            In this guide, we'll explain how to build a PC step by step, starting with understanding your PC needs, exploring the different parts of a computer, and guiding you through the PC build process.<br>

      <p style="font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; color: khaki; text-align:justify">As with anything you build, understanding what you want to create is usually the best place to start.

        You might be a die-hard gamer looking for a custom gaming PC, a student doing research and editing, or someone who uses their computer for day-to-day tasks.
        
        Once you know what kind of PC you want, you'll understand what kind of hardware and performance you need â€” and avoid paying for things you don't.</p>

            <p style="font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; color: khaki; text-align: justify;">The amount of money you spend on computer parts can vary greatly, so it's a good idea to have a realistic budget in mind ahead of time.

                Expect to pay more if you're going for the best possible performance in all of your PC components. Faster processors cost more than slower ones, and newer generations of memory and storage with more capacity generally cost more than older ones with less.
                
                Since memory and storage take a large chunk of the cost of a new computer, building your own PC gives you the flexibility to save on these components if you wish. While RAM and SSD costs rise with the amount of capacity they offer, they can be less expensive than buying pre-installed components that are often inadequate and need to be upgraded quickly.</p>
